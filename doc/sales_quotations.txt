Sales Quotations as a separate menu option
------------------------------------------

You can now create Sales Quotations in a separate form. You enter the 'Valid until' 
date. These Sales Quotations can later be used for creating a Sales Order.

There is a new menu choice under Inquiries, Sales Quotation Inquiry. If the 
'Valid until' has been passed, the Sales Quotation is not shown. But you can 
select 'Show All' and all the Sales Quotation inside the period will be shown.

In this Inquiry you have the option to look at the entire Quotation, edit the 
Quotation, print the Quotation and make a Sales Order from the Quotation.

The Sales Quotations will not be deleted, so it is possible to use it agan and 
maybe edit it for use again.

The Sales Quotations can however be deleted when editing. And when deleting a 
fiscal year, the Quotations will be deleted.

The Sales Order print out can still be selected to be printed as a Quote should 
you prefer that.
