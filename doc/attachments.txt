Attaching documents
-------------------

In the Setup tab, Maintenance you can attach scanned documents to transactions. 
You can do that here, but you can also do it after you have entered a supplier 
invoice or supplier credit note. There will be a direct link so you don't have 
to remember the transaction number.
